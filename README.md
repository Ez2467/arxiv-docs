# info.arxiv.org pages

Help, about, policy and other pages for arXiv.

## Overview

This is where to make edits to the about, help, labs, new and other pages at
info.arxiv.org. These are written in
[markdown](https://daringfireball.net/projects/markdown/) and turned into HTML
pages with [mkdocs-material](https://squidfunk.github.io/mkdocs-material/).

## How to do a Quick Edit on github

To do a quick edit, use this is a 3 step process:

1st: Make your edit and commit to the develop branch

2nd: Make a PR from develop to master, get that reviewed

3rd: Merge the PR to master

This commits directly to the `develop` branch. If you are doing a more involved
group of edits or changes, please use a process like git flow. If you are not
familiar with this ask a dev or an admin to help you.

### 1st: Make your edit on github
- To edit a page first go to the info.arxiv.org page you want to edit. Ex https://info.arxiv.org/help/gzip.html

- There click on the pencil icon to edit the page. That will take you to the corresponding page in github.

- On the page you want to edit in github, click the dropdown arrow next to the pencil and select `Edit in place` and you can edit the page contents right in github.

- After you have made changes, click preview to see how it will look when completed. 
**Please note:** There are slight differences between the markdown we use and what github uses.

- Once you are happy with your changes you can save by clicking on the blue `Commit changes` button in the upper right hand corner.
Commit is the term github and git use for saving.

- Add a brief note in the `Commit message` area summarizing your edit. You may add longer
note in the `Extended description` area if you have more to say about your changes.

- Make sure you have an email associated with your commits.

- Create a `new branch for this request and start a pull request` will be selected
- Name your branch after your JIRA ticket to link it. Ex arxivce-1503-update-arxiv-docs-readme

- **Please note:** The above step will only put your changes on develop and they will not be viewable on info.arxiv.org. At this point you have only saved the edit in github.

If you have more changes to make at this time you may make and commit them all on the branch you created. The additional changes you commit will be grouped together when you make your Pull Request in the next step.

### 2nd: Make a Pull Request from `develop` to `master`
Once you have done all the changes you wanted you need to get your changes reviewed. This is done by "creating a PR." PR stands for pull request.

To make a new PR click the "Pull Requests" tab on the top of a github page. Then
click the green "New Pull Request." You want changes from the branch `develop` to get put
into the branch called `master`.

From there you can give your PR a title and add a note about it. Also add
reviewers on the left. Then click the green "Create Pull Request"

Github will email all the reviewers.

### 3rd: Merge the PR to `master` to Deploy Changes

To get your changes deployed, merge it to the branch called `master`. This will
cause automated scripts to deploy the changes to info.arxiv.org.  If you are
unsure how to do this, ask a dev or admin to do it for you.

## Authoring Markdown
See [AUTHORING.md](AUTHORING.MD)

## Building on your local machine

Instead of using github to edit you can check all the files for arxiv-docs to
your laptop to edit and preview.

```bash
git clone git@github.com:arXiv/arxiv-docs.git
cd arxiv-docs
python --version
# 3.8.12
python -m venv docs-venv
source docs-venv/bin/activate
pip install -r requirements.txt
mkdocs serve
google-chrome https://localhost:8000/index.html
```

Then you will have the site served locally with hot reloading on edits. In your
browser, go to http://localhost:8000/index.html

# Deployment to info.arxiv.org

Commits or merges to `arxiv-docs` `master` branch will deploy the site.

The cloud build YAML files combined with CloudBuild triggers in
`arxiv-production` comprise the deployment pipeline for `arxiv-docs`.

# Previews of PRs

PRs that will merge to the branch `develop` on the github repo
`arxiv-docs` will deploy previews at
https://storage.googleapis.com/arxiv-docs-prs/YOUR_BRANCH_NAME/about/index.html

Note that the home page specifically does not exist, but any other page can be accessed with its URL path.
This preview can been seen by the public, everything in the github
arxiv-docs repo can also be seen by the public.

Direct commits to the `develop` branch will not generate a preview.

## Historical site content
See https://github.com/arXiv/arxiv-docs/releases for branches prior to 2023 when content was shifted to the source/ directory.
