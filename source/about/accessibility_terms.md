# Accessibility Terms

arXiv is committed to creating an accessible experience for all users. Below are useful descriptions and terms, our thinking behind this commitment, and our roadmap for reaching and sustainably maintaining an accessible platform for the entire arXiv community.

## Important terms

**Accessibility** = The practice of making digital products functional for as many people as possible, including those using assistive technologies.

**ADA** = The Americans with Disabilities Act of 1990.

**WCAG** = The Web Content Accessibility Guidelines are developed and maintained by the W3C, who also develop international web standards for HTML, CSS, and more. WCAG 2.1 compliance is mandated by Cornell University.

## Accessible arXiv

The arXiv community is diverse in every way and includes users with visual or other impairments, those who use assistive technology, and many other factors that can affect one's ability navigate the internet. Maintaining, expanding, and improving access for all users is our goal and must necessarily include accessibility.

The reasons for prioritizing accessibility are vast but below are the top ten we have identified for our platform and users:

1. arXiv's body of research papers is free and open to everyone from all over the world. A fully accessible website actively demonstrates arXiv's commitment to open access knowledge. And if it is not accessible it is not truly open.
2. A commitment to accessibility will positively reflect on and strengthen arXiv's commitment to science and puts arXiv on the right side of history.
3. Accessible design offers clear and direct benefits to arXiv's extremely diverse and international user base. Accessible design is by its nature flexible, allowing content to faithfully render across a broad spectrum of devices, platforms, assistive technologies, operating systems, and bandwidths. We don't know what the future holds in terms of technology and device proliferation, but maintaining accessible and standards compliant code will natively communicate with assistive technologies in a reliable and predictable manner over the long-term.
4. Accessible websites, through their emphasis on core content and meaning and rejection of superfluous, bandwidth-hogging filler, greatly benefit those with a slow internet connection or limited bandwidth.
5. The number of people with disabilities is large and growing. At least one billion people – 15% of the world’s population – have a recognized disability ([WHO global report](https://apps.who.int/iris/bitstream/handle/10665/44575/9789240685215_eng.pdf)). In the USA it's one in four adults ([CDC report](https://www.cdc.gov/media/releases/2018/p0816-disability.html)) and rising ([2018 DHS national report](https://disabilitycompendium.org/sites/default/files/user-uploads/2018_Compendium_Accessible_AbobeReaderFriendly.pdf)). In addition there are many more who do not formally identify as having a disability but have permanent, temporary, or situational impairments that affect one's ability to fully interact with many web interfaces. Some examples are visual impairments (blind, requiring magnification, screen glare, and more), mobility impairments (physical injuries, paralysis, and more), and cognitive and learning disabilities (requiring additional time, use of highlighting tools, and more). Providing open access to arXiv for all users includes deploying and maintaining an accessible platform that communicates reliably with assistive technologies.
6. Moderators and administrators are a critical part of arXiv's longevity and success. To ensure arXiv is open to all qualified moderators and administrators the interfaces that they use must be accessible too.
7. arXiv's user base is international and accessibility laws in countries besides the USA will become increasingly relevant and urgent in the future. Compliance with existing guidelines and a firm commitment to clean semantic markup will limit risk for arXiv and provide a strong foundation for future changes.
8. arXiv has an established history of being in compliance with international HTML standards. Current semantic HTML5 standards are the next logical step in maintaining a compliant codebase, and are closely linked to accessibility.
9. Studies have shown that an [accessibility-focused development mindset](https://habengirma.com/2017/09/13/people-with-disabilities-drive-innovation/) leads to more innovation and higher levels of satisfaction for all users. Accessibility - which emphasizes clarity of content and meaning - has far-reaching positive impacts.
10. Last but not least accessibility is not just a great business practice and the right thing to do, it is a legal requirement and Cornell University policy.

## Roadmap to accessibility
After extensive research with diverse arXiv users, we have shared our findings in our [accessibility research report](accessibility_research_report.md). In brief, while the website arxiv.org needs further remediation to attain full accessibility, our community has focused our efforts making the *research papers* we host as accessible as possible. While it is not an easy goal, we believe it is achievable, and welcome you to read our report and share your feedback.

## How the arXiv community can help

A fully accessible arXiv is important, meaningful, and ambitious. Significant development resources and user testing are needed to reach our targets and the arXiv community may wish to help in the following ways:

- [Donate](https://arxiv.org/about/give) and support creation of an accessible arXiv.
- Learn about [arXiv Labs](https://labs.arxiv.org) and developing tools that benefit the arXiv community.
- Join the [arXiv usability testing list](user-testing.md) and share your feedback and insights.
