# Policies for specific content types

The standards for [moderation and scholarly interest](/help/moderation/index.html) are the basis for
acceptance (or not) of submissions. 
In general, the guidelines below represent what types of content typically are and are not accepted.

  
## Content types that are typically NOT accepted include

- Abstract-only submissions
- Book announcements
- Book reviews
- Calls for papers
- Course projects
- Information about political causes (even those with potential special interest to the academic community)
- News items or opinion pieces
- Patent applications
- Posters
- Presentation slides
- Proposals for future research
- Supplemental material that is not embedded in the full article
- Wokshop or conference summaries
- Undergraduate or high school research
- Very short work

## Content types that typically are accepted include

- [Articles](#Articles)
- [Theses](#Theses)
- [Conference proceedings](/help/submit_index.html)
- [Books or book chapters](#Books)
- [Lecture notes](#Lecture%20notes)
- [Translations](/help/translations.html)
- [Comments and Reply to Comments](#Comments)

## Articles

Research articles are the primary content type submitted to arXiv. Articles should be complete final drafts.

## Theses

A thesis, like all other content types, should have novel results and be of plausible interest to professional researchers. Undergraduate or Master's level researchers should consult their advisor before submitting to arXiv.
  
## Conference proceedings

Please refer to [Submission of indexes for conference proceedings](/help/submit_index.html)

## Books

Most submissions to arXiv are research articles, but we do accept other content types, including books and book chapters. Similar to article submissions, books and book chapters should be self-contained research with novel results or current reviews that are of interest to professional researchers in the field. Textbooks and books that are not research are not typically accepted. There are some exceptions though.

### Books as complete works

Books are acceptable as complete manuscripts as long as they are of interest. This format is preferred if the individual chapters are all by the same author(s).

### Individual book chapters

Individual book chapters may be submitted and will be moderated by the same standards as research articles.

### Book Front matter/Introductions/Appendices

An Introduction chapter or Appendix section would not typically be accepted on its own as they are not self-contained or of interest. In order to allow for a complete book to be posted to arXiv, where the chapters are submitted individually, we will allow a submission for the “non-research” sections of the book when:
The front matter, introductory chapters, appendices, etc. are combined into a submission that includes links to the individual chapters that are on arXiv. 


## Lecture Notes

Lecture notes, like all other content types, should have novel results and be of plausible interest to professional researchers. In some fields lecture notes are developed around novel research and written in a format similar to research articles that may be acceptable to submit to arXiv. 

Lecture notes that are pedagogical or that cover standard material should not be submitted.

## Translations

<a name="Comments"></a>

## Comments and Reply to Comments

arXiv encourages dialogue and debate about scientific matters. Normally this occurs via a series of papers that build on or critically examine each other. These are moderated each individually as standalone papers. Sometimes, a remark on or note about another paper that is not a full standalone paper is of sufficient interest to arXiv readers. These can be put on arXiv as so-called "comments-on" papers. All normal moderation criteria apply to these, except that they need not be complete standalone papers.

Requirements for Comments and Replies:

- "Comments-on" content type must have a Title: "Comment(s) on '<title-of-original-paper>'" and the Comments field must contain "comment(s) on <arXiv-ID>".
- A response from the original authors is always permitted and must have a Title "Reply to comment(s) on '<title-of-original-paper>'" and the Comments field must contain "reply to comment(s) on <arXiv-ID>" in the comment field.
- In rare cases where the original paper is not on arXiv (see content rules) the arXiv-ID is replaced by a DOI.
- A further chain of responses and counter-responses is allowed as version updates of the original two above; these will not be accepted as new papers with new arXiv-IDs. A given author or co-author may submit only one Comment on a particular paper. Any subsequent issues the author wishes to raise must be done through version updates of the original Comment.
