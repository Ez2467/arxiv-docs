# Author Registration

To begin registration, visit the [registration form](https://arxiv.org/user/register).

Your username must be unique and cannot be changed.  

arXiv registration also asks for your name and your Organization. If you are unaffiliated you may enter "Indepdendent" as your organization.

Select which archives you are most likely to submit to. This will filter the category options available if you submit an article in the future. 

We will then verify the email for your account.

Please [review account related policies](policies/identity_and_affiliation.md).


## Account Password

Account password requirements:

-  8 characters or more in length

- May contain upper/lowercase letters, numbers, and one or more underscores (_) - one underscore is required

- May not contain any other special characters besides underscore - no other punctuation or symbols are allowed (ex. $, ., -,@)

Some successful password examples could be: “Pass_Word_123” or “pAssWoRd_123”

As with all passwords, we recommend that you keep yours safe. The
password can be changed from your [personal information page](https://arxiv.org/user/).
If you forget your password, you can [recover your
password](https://arxiv.org/user/lost_password) using your registered e-mail address.

## Email

If you need to change your preferred e-mail address, for example because
you have changed institutions, then you should visit the [e-mail change
form](https://arxiv.org/auth/email-change-form). This will ask for your new e-mail
address and will send an e-mail with a verification code to your new
address to make sure that your new address is correct. 

Please allow up to an hour
for delivery of the verification code, before requesting a new one. If you try two
times and still have not received a verification code, or your verification code 
does not work, please contact [arXiv user support](https://arxiv.org/support).
