# arXiv.org - The math archive (12/97)

The math archive was introduced on Dec 1 1997 with the following announcement:

> We are introducing the **math archive**. The idea is to facilitate growth to areas of mathematics not covered by the current archive structure. The math archive has the same features as the current archives (searching, subscribing, web downloading and so on) with one important addition: Authors must include a **Subj-class** header, chosen from a canonical list. This is most easily done with a select menu for [web submission](../help/submit/index.md), but the header can alternatively be included in e-mail submissions; see our [abstract preparation help](../help/prep.md). You may subscribe to any subset of classifications; see our [subscription help](../help/subscribe.md). In this sense, each subject class functions as a new archive. This also makes it very easy to expand the archive by adding new subject classifications.
